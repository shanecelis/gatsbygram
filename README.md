Hi Andrew,

Ok. I got this working.  I forgot how I did it, which is why this repository
is getting to you so late.  I couldn't get it working again.  But I figured
it out.  So what you've got to do is run the following commands in your terminal:

    $ git clone https://github.com/shanecelis/gatsbygram.git
    $ cd gatsbygram 
    $ npm install
    $ gatsby build
    $ gatsby serve

And that should get you the local gatsby server with our slight change to the icon.

I'd recommend forking this repo on github, that way I can see what changes you make.
